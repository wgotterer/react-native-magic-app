## DEMO COMING SOON. LEARNING HOW TO DEPLOY TO APP STORE NOW!


# Description 

While I haven't touched a card in a while, Magic The Gathering played a big role in my childhood. 
It swept me away into a different world while challenging me to think critically and strategically. 
Alas, I want to present the beginning of a mobile app built with React Native that allows one to view Magic cards based on categories, 
create a favorites list, and filter out cards based on searching preferences. 
Using navigation in React Native, as well incorporating Redux into the mix, can be a challenge. 
In the near future,  I will be recording more in depth videos in which I dive into the code and touch specifically on those two points. 
As I keep learning React Native I’m hoping to add a user login, deploy the app, and connect to a backend database in the future.
